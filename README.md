# high-school-maze
(a horrible) A maze generator and three solvers created about one year into my programming journey in high school

This was done late in the evening; maybe it was night or even morning by the time it was finished. 
The assignment/wager did not take the actual code into account, only the output in the console window. That led to this horrible mess of code that is not very readable,
but it works, and that was all that mattered.
